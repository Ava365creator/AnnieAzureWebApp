# Notes:
# 1) Create an App Service in Azure and get the Publish Profile (in the Overview -> Get publish profile)
#    then add it to GitHub repo secrets as AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE.
# 2) This workflow zips the repo and deploys it. For Next.js apps that require a Node server,
#    ensure your App Service startup command runs the correct start script, e.g. `npm run start`.
# 3) If you prefer to deploy only the `.next` output or use a custom build artifact folder,
#    update the `zip` command and `package` path accordingly.
